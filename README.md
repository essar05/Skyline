Huge thanks to https://www.youtube.com/user/makinggameswithben, without whom I wouldn't have been able to code this.

I do this for educational purposes and, of course, for fun !

#### How to build

Nothing special to say, I've included all the dependencies needed. It should be as simple as opening the solution file in Visual Studio, building and running.
